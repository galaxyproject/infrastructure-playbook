        # Currently the Hub is (manually) configured in CloudFront, until HTTPS Alias Mode support hits browsers it is
        # mostly unusable. Details and bugs to track can be found here: https://kalfeher.com/https-current-state/

        # Once support exists you should be able to translate the existing config to the playbook using GTN as a
        # reference. Even once supported you will need to keep the A record serving for some time (possibly forever) for
        # older clients, but its stability matters less once most clients use the CDN.
