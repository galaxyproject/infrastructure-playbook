# NOTE: Enabling GitHub SSO auth appears to disable all other auth options including the local superuser account, and
# the Sentry devs appear to be planning not to fix this:
#   https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/16247
# Also since I installed the GitHub app using my GitHub account and the Sentry local superuser, my account was linked
# with the superuser and could not be unlinked. I changed the superuser account's email to my own so now there is no
# longer a local superuser account. I could probably recreate it but it would be impossible to log in to anyway with SSO
# enabled.
