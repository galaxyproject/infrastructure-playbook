# This is used to solve the following issue:
#
# 1. keyboard-interactive is required for 2FA hosts even in cases where 2FA is not required
# 2. Ansible uses `ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=gssapi-with-mic,gssapi-keyex,hostbased,publickey`
# 3. OpenSSH only considers the first config option it encounters, if there are duplicates
# 4. Ansible only provides a way to *append* ssh args, unless you use the global `ssh_args` option in ansible.cfg, which
#    we do not want since we don't want to enable keyboard-interactive on non-2FA hosts
#
# To use, set `ansible_ssh_executable=./.ssh-keyboard-interactive` on a host's inventory entry
#
